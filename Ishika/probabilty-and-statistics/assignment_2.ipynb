    "\n",
    "If we look at this intuitively, we can say that getting 3 hits out of 5 while being an expert makes more sense than being able to do it otherwise.

    "This drastically increased the probability that Alex is an expert given the evidence. Although our assumption was only 1% initially, it was sufficient to increase the belief upto 27.8% as our evidence was strong enough to favour the condition that Alex is an expert. Now, when we started off with a considerable assumption already, that increased the belief upto 90.5%. In this case, the prior strongly influences the result and the posteriori is highly sensitive to any changes made in it. \n",

    "\n",
    "**Interpretation**\n",
    "- Rejecting $H_0$ implies that the data we obtained from sampling was sufficient to conclude the same. In hypothesis testing, this means that our Test Statistic lies in the rejection region of the distribution defined by $\\alpha$, i.e. the level of significance. $\\alpha$ represents the probability of rejecting the Null Hypothesis when it is actually true. If our test statistic lies beyond the acceptable region defined by this $\\alpha$, it means we have enough evidence to reject the Null Hypothesis, and the result supports the alternative. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "â€‹In case we fail to reject $H_0$, it means the data we collected from samples was not enough to reject $H_0$. The point of Hypothesis Testing is to see if the evidence we have is sufficient to doubt the Null Hypothesis. In the first case, we said that we can reject $H_0$ given the evidence since it strongly goes against it, but in this case our conclusion is that the Null Hypothesis cannot be rejected as the evidence is not strong enough to outright deny it.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In a smaller sample, some random factors get added into our data which influence the result, leading to errors. Larger number of samples help reducing the effect of these factors and providing a better basis to reject $H_0$ when it is actually false,thus improving the power of the test.\n",
